# Grabify
# I participated in a group project for an academic assignment, where I contributed by developing the backend and database for the application.

Aim : Is to connect all the shops in an area through an application to the Digital market <br>

Technologies : <br>
1. Flutter (Frontend) <br>
2. Django ( Python based framework for API, Backend ) <br>
3. Sqlite3 ( Database Management ) <br>

This app is here to revolutionize the way we used to order things in our college,we are trying to bring the whole buying experience of the small shops we have in our near vicinity (i.e. Neethi Medical Store, Milma Booth, Mandi Shop, AJ Bakers , etc.). As, we know the major crowd we have here is Students the lines at these shops increases day by day and it is a very tiring process, So we are trying to minimize the waiting time by taking the order and then prompting the shop owner to prepare the order or pack the order and send a notification that the order is prepared so that the Person ordering can go and Collect the Order!<br><br>
